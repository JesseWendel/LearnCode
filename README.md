# LearnCode
Learning to Code. Wahoo!

I'm going to learn Python. Lisp. (Scheme to start; plus Lisp.) Also C. Java. PERL. The Bash shell obviously. And no doubt others.
After 30+ years as a sysadmin, half of that running my own businesses, plus a decade before that just hacking around - all the way back to punch cards. Really. - it is time to learn code.

All that is in this repository are sample files, school files, working files. If I do anything interesting - not school - I'll put it into its own repository.

Questions? Contact me via Github.
